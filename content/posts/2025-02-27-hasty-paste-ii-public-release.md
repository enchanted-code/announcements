Hasty Paste is Back!!!

Hasty Paste II is a complete rewrite of the original app, therefore is not compatible with the original.

Check it out here: [github.com/enchant97/hasty-paste](https://github.com/enchant97/hasty-paste).

It implements many of the features missing from the original and is faster than V1, due to the newly written server. Unlike V1, V2 now requires a database (SQLite only at the moment) for storing all the extra data.

## Changes
- Use Go for even speedier pasting
- Add assets to your pastes
- Users with SSO support (with anonymous user support)
- Paste visibilities
- Customisable paste slugs
- Paste rendering for plain, markdown and code
- Paste expiry
